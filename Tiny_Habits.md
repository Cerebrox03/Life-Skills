# Tiny Habits

## 1.) In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea in this essay was how the speaker shows dedication to connecting with the audience. Waking up at 4 AM to attend the event shows how committed they are, and it helps create a stronger bond with the audience. It shows that even small actions, like getting up early, can make a big difference in how a speaker connects with the crowd. This dedication highlights how much the speaker values the audience's time, making the whole experience feel more real and personal.

## 2.) How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

B = MAP stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. This formula can help make habits easier by focusing on the three factors:

- **M(Motivation)**: Ensure that you are motivated enough to do the habit. This could be by linking the habit to something meaningful or rewarding.
- **A(Ability)**: Make the habit easy to do. Break it down into simple actions or reduce friction by preparing in advance.
- **P(Prompt)**: Create a strong reminder or cue for the habit. This can be a visual cue, an alarm, or an existing habit that triggers the new one.

## 3.) Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Celebrating after a successful habit reinforces the behavior and signals to your brain that it’s rewarding. This creates a positive feedback loop, helping to cement the habit. When you celebrate, you increase the dopamine levels associated with the action, making it more likely that you will repeat it in the future. As the book suggests, "Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit" because celebrating strengthens the neural connections related to the behavior.

## 4.) In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea in this video was the idea of small improvements adding up over time. James Caird explains how making tiny, daily changes—just 1% better each day—can lead to huge successes. He gave the example of how British Cycling went from being a pretty average team to dominating big events like the Tour de France. This shows that instead of expecting big results right away, focusing on small improvements every day can really pay off in the long run.

## 5.) What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book's perspective on identity is that habits shape who we are. Instead of focusing solely on outcomes, it suggests thinking about the person you want to become. Identity-based habits revolve around asking, "Who do I wish to become?" rather than "What do I want to achieve?" By changing your habits, you are changing your identity. The book emphasizes that every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to be. If you change your identity then only long term change can be seen.

### 6.) Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

The book suggests that to make a habit easier, you need to reduce friction and make the behavior as simple as possible. This can be done by setting up your environment to support the habit. For example, making the habit obvious by placing reminders in your path, or making the action easier by breaking it down into small, manageable steps. If you want to develop a new habit, like exercising more, the book advises making it easier by laying out your workout clothes the night before or starting with just a few minutes of exercise to get the ball rolling. The idea is to make the habit effortless and easy to start.

### 7.) Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

To make a habit harder to do, the book recommends increasing the friction or difficulty of performing the habit. This can be achieved by removing easy access to triggers or cues that lead to the bad habit. For example, if you want to stop watching TV too much, you could unplug the TV or hide the remote. You could also use apps that limit your screen time to make it harder to fall back into the habit. The goal is to make the habit inconvenient or difficult enough that you think twice before doing it.

### 8.) Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

**Habit: Reading more books**

- **Cue (Make it obvious)**: Leave a book on your pillow, so it’s the first thing you see when you go to bed.
- **Attractiveness**: Choose books you are really excited to read, or make it a fun experience by having a cozy reading space with a warm drink.
- **Ease**: Start by reading just one page a day. The easier you make it, the more likely you’ll stick to it.
- **Response satisfaction**: Track your progress and celebrate finishing each chapter. You could also join a book club to share your excitement with others.

### 9.) Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

**Habit: Spending too much time on social media**

- **Cue (Make it invisible)**: Move social media apps off your home screen or delete them during certain hours of the day.
- **Unattractive**: Turn off notifications, so you're not constantly reminded of new posts. This makes it less tempting.
- **Hard**: Set a screen time limit on your phone or use apps that block access to social media after a certain time.
- **Unsatisfying response**: Replace social media with something more enriching, like reading or going for a walk, so you get a more fulfilling experience instead of mindlessly scrolling.
