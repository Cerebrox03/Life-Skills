## Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

One point that was new to me was:

- **Joining meetings 5–10 minutes early to connect with the team.**  
  I hadn’t really thought about how much those few minutes can matter. Usually, I join right on time or even a bit late, just focused on the meeting agenda. But getting in early gives you a chance to have casual conversations with teammates, build stronger relationships, and create a more friendly, open team atmosphere—especially when working remotely. It’s a small habit that can make a big difference.

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

I think I need to work on:

- **Getting better at asking for help when I'm stuck.**

Sometimes I tend to say things like _"The build is not working"_ or _"Can you help me? Something’s broken"_, but without providing enough details. This makes it harder and slower for others to assist me.

#### How I plan to improve:

- **Be more specific** – Clearly explain what I’m trying to do, what the issue is, and what I’ve already tried.
- **Use visuals** – Include screenshots or record a short Loom video if it helps explain the problem better.
- **Share code properly** – Use GitHub Gists or CodeSandbox to let others view the code in context.
- **Model my questions after good bug reports** – Look at how issues are described in open-source projects and try to follow that style.

The goal is to reduce back-and-forth and make it easy for others to help me right away.
