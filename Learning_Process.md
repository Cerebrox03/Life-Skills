### Question 2:
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  
I haven't watched the video, but from Barbara Oakley's work, one interesting idea is how the brain shifts between different modes of thinking: focusing on a problem and then letting the subconscious process it. This idea emphasizes that learning isn't just about constant attention but also allowing the mind to wander and rest.

### Question 3:

- **Active mode** is when you focus intensely on a specific problem or task, engaging your conscious mind.  
- **Diffused mode** is when you let your mind wander or rest, allowing subconscious connections and insights to form.
